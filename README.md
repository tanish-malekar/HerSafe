## Detailed Description üìù

### 1. Discreet SOS Messaging through Steganography
For many women in abusive relationships who live under constant monitoring, finding a way to ask for help without alerting their abusers is critical. SafeSupportAI introduces a revolutionary SOS messaging system, using **steganography** to encode distress signals within innocent-looking images, like flowers or landscapes.

### How it Works üõ†Ô∏è

On the user side, SafeSupportAI‚Äôs process begins with message generation, where the user enters brief details of their situation. Our LLM expands these inputs into complete, coherent sentences. The user then chooses an image prompt, like a flower or landscape, which the AI generates and encodes with the distress message through steganography. Once complete, the user shares this seemingly ordinary image on social media, where it appears innocuous to others, including any abusers monitoring the profile.

On the authority side, SafeSupportAI's system continuously monitors social media for SOS images tagged with specific hashtags. Once detected, these images are decoded to extract the hidden message using reverse steganography. The decoded text is then broken down into structured segments for efficient analysis, after which it is stored in MongoDB, where cases are organized by severity level to prioritize urgent responses.

### Technical Details 

| API Route            | Description                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/text-generation`   | Expands user input via AWS Bedrock                        |
| `/img-generation`    | Generates an image from the user‚Äôs prompt                   |
| `/encode`            | Encodes text into the generated image                       |
| `/decode`            | Decodes text from the image                                 |
| `/text-decomposition`| Decomposes the decoded text into structured sections        |
| `/save-extracted-data` | Saves the structured data in MongoDB                       |

**Working**
**User Side**  
- Message Generation When the user inputs basic information about their situation, the LLM leverages this data to create syntactically complete, contextually relevant sentences that represent the user‚Äôs distress message.
- Image Creation The user selects a theme or prompt for an image (such as ‚Äúflower,‚Äù ‚Äúlandscape,‚Äù or ‚Äúfood‚Äù), which the image generation module uses to create an innocuous-looking image with the selected theme.
- Message Encoding: The generated distress message is embedded into the AI-generated image using steganography, where the textual message is concealed within pixel data in a way that is imperceptible to the naked eye. This process uses encoding algorithms that maintain the image‚Äôs visual integrity while securely embedding the message.
- Sharing: The encoded image, which appears visually harmless, can be shared publicly on social media platforms. This avoids detection from an abuser monitoring the user's activity while providing a hidden channel for SOS messages.

**Authority Side**  
- Monitoring with Cron: A cron job runs at regular intervals to monitor social media channels for specific hashtags or identifiers associated with encoded SOS images. This background job allows the system to scan and detect potential distress signals in real time.
- Image Decoding: Once an image with an encoded SOS message is detected, it undergoes reverse steganography decoding. This involves extracting the pixel-embedded message, isolating the encoded data, and reconstructing it into a readable text format.
- Text Decomposition: The decoded message is analyzed and broken down into structured data fields (e.g., urgency level, nature of the abuse) using natural language processing techniques. This decomposition facilitates the classification of the message‚Äôs severity and content type.
- Storage in MongoDB: The parsed data is stored in MongoDB in a structured format, utilizing MongoDB‚Äôs document-based architecture to facilitate efficient retrieval and querying. Data fields are indexed for real-time access, enabling authorities to prioritize cases based on urgency and ensuring streamlined incident response.



##  **2. AI Avatar for Mental Health Support** 

For many survivors of abuse, the **psychological toll** is just as devastating as the physical harm. However, only **10%** of women experiencing domestic abuse seek mental health support, often due to fear of judgment, lack of privacy, or limited access to professional services.  
- Over **80%** of women facing abuse are at a higher risk of mental health issues such as **anxiety, depression**, and **PTSD**.  
- **SafeSupportAI** aims to bridge this gap, offering an accessible, **empathetic, and private** support system for women in distress.



###  **How It Works:**

**SafeSupportAI‚Äôs AI Avatar** provides **24/7 mental health support** through **confidential, non-judgmental conversations**. The avatar listens to users' concerns and offers:
- **Personalized coping strategies**  
- **Calming techniques**  
- **Relevant resources** to manage mental health, tailored specifically to the emotional needs of abuse survivors.

Whether a user experiences **panic attacks**, **emotional exhaustion**, or simply needs a safe space to express their feelings, **SafeSupportAI** is always there, offering a compassionate presence when needed most. The best part? It's completely confidential‚Äîno need to worry about being overheard or judged.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details:**

- **Model and Animation Loading:**  
  Upon initiating the conversation, the AI fetches **3D model files** (.glb format) and **animations** to bring the avatar to life. The avatar‚Äôs **facial morph targets** and animation sequences are initialized using **useGLTF**, allowing for **human-like interactions** with empathy.

- **User Data Retrieval:**  
  When a user interacts with the AI avatar, the system retrieves relevant data from previous conversations (stored **securely in MongoDB**) to offer a **personalized experience**. This enables the AI to understand the user‚Äôs emotional state, preferences, and history, ensuring continuity in support.

- **Natural Language Understanding:**  
  The AI uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, such as **Gemini**, to process the user‚Äôs input, understanding the **context**, **emotional tone**, and **urgency**. It then generates responses with **personalized coping strategies**, **calming techniques**, and other **mental health resources**.

- **Audio Generation and Lip-Sync:**  
  The AI‚Äôs responses are converted into **natural-sounding speech** using **ElevenLabs**‚Äô **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** technology. The audio is base64-encoded, and synchronized with the avatar‚Äôs **lip movements**, ensuring **realistic lip-syncing**.

- **Facial Expression Mapping:**  
  **Titan Text G1 - Express** provides specific cues (e.g., **smiling**, **frowning**) that are mapped to the avatar‚Äôs morph targets. This allows the avatar to show appropriate **emotional expressions**, reflecting the user‚Äôs emotions such as **fear**, **sadness**, or **relief**.

- **Animation Management:**  
  The avatar transitions smoothly between different **animations** (e.g., from **Idle** to **Talking**), making the interaction feel natural and **engaging**, reinforcing the emotional tone of the conversation.
