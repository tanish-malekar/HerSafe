## Detailed Description üìù

### 1. Discreet SOS Messaging through Steganography
For many women in abusive relationships who live under constant monitoring, finding a way to ask for help without alerting their abusers is critical. Haven introduces a revolutionary SOS messaging system, using **steganography** to encode distress signals within innocent-looking images, like flowers or landscapes.

### How it Works üõ†Ô∏è

On the user side, Haven‚Äôs process begins with message generation, where the user enters brief details of their situation. Our LLM expands these inputs into complete, coherent sentences. The user then chooses an image prompt, like a flower or landscape, which the AI generates and encodes with the distress message through steganography. Once complete, the user shares this seemingly ordinary image on social media, where it appears innocuous to others, including any abusers monitoring the profile.

On the authority side, Haven's system continuously monitors social media for SOS images tagged with specific hashtags. Once detected, these images are decoded to extract the hidden message using reverse steganography. The decoded text is then broken down into structured segments for efficient analysis, after which it is stored in MongoDB, where cases are organized by severity level to prioritize urgent responses.

### What Sets Haven Apart üå†

- **Fast and Simple Communication:** Women in high-stress situations can quickly type keywords; our AI generates a full distress message, reducing time and risk.
- **Innovative Steganography Approach:** Hidden messages within everyday photos ensure total privacy from abusers, making the post appear harmless while alerting authorities.
- **Overcoming Unreliable Channels:** Many government websites are inaccessible due to technical issues or restrictions. Haven provides a reliable, always-accessible option to seek help, bypassing these barriers.


### Technical Details 

| API Route            | Description                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/text-generation`   | Expands user input via AWS Bedrock                        |
| `/img-generation`    | Generates an image from the user‚Äôs prompt                   |
| `/encode`            | Encodes text into the generated image                       |
| `/decode`            | Decodes text from the image                                 |
| `/text-decomposition`| Decomposes the decoded text into structured sections        |
| `/save-extracted-data` | Saves the structured data in MongoDB                       |

**Working**
**User Side**  
- Message Generation When the user inputs basic information about their situation, the LLM leverages this data to create syntactically complete, contextually relevant sentences that represent the user‚Äôs distress message.
- Image Creation The user selects a theme or prompt for an image (such as ‚Äúflower,‚Äù ‚Äúlandscape,‚Äù or ‚Äúfood‚Äù), which the image generation module uses to create an innocuous-looking image with the selected theme.
- Message Encoding: The generated distress message is embedded into the AI-generated image using steganography, where the textual message is concealed within pixel data in a way that is imperceptible to the naked eye. This process uses encoding algorithms that maintain the image‚Äôs visual integrity while securely embedding the message.
- Sharing: The encoded image, which appears visually harmless, can be shared publicly on social media platforms. This avoids detection from an abuser monitoring the user's activity while providing a hidden channel for SOS messages.

**Authority Side**  
- Monitoring with Cron: A cron job runs at regular intervals to monitor social media channels for specific hashtags or identifiers associated with encoded SOS images. This background job allows the system to scan and detect potential distress signals in real time.
- Image Decoding: Once an image with an encoded SOS message is detected, it undergoes reverse steganography decoding. This involves extracting the pixel-embedded message, isolating the encoded data, and reconstructing it into a readable text format.
- Text Decomposition: The decoded message is analyzed and broken down into structured data fields (e.g., urgency level, nature of the abuse) using natural language processing techniques. This decomposition facilitates the classification of the message‚Äôs severity and content type.
- Storage in MongoDB: The parsed data is stored in MongoDB in a structured format, utilizing MongoDB‚Äôs document-based architecture to facilitate efficient retrieval and querying. Data fields are indexed for real-time access, enabling authorities to prioritize cases based on urgency and ensuring streamlined incident response.

#### Culprit Similarity Matching

When an authority selects "Find Match," the system uses cosine similarity on stored embeddings to find the top N similar profiles, enabling quick connections across related cases.

**Working**
- Data Embedding: The details provided (physical traits, behaviors, etc.) are passed through an embedding model, creating a dense vector that represents the data in multi-dimensional space.
- Vector-Based Search: When a match search is triggered, a vector search is executed in MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. Cosine similarity is calculated to determine the closest matching profiles.
- Match Ranking and Filtering: Results are ranked by similarity score, allowing for threshold-based filtering to adjust for specificity.

### Impact
In a world where 60% of abused women lack private communication options, reaching out for help becomes nearly impossible. Abusers often control access to phones, messages, and the internet, trapping women in a cycle of silence and fear. Discreet SOS Messaging addresses this urgent need for a safe, covert communication channel, allowing women to reach out without fear of being caught. It‚Äôs a solution designed to break the silence when speaking out is dangerous.\

### **How AI Is Used Throughout the Project ü§ñ:**

**(Category: Best Use of Amazon Bedrock)**

- Text Generation and Text Expansion ‚úçÔ∏è

  - AI powers Haven's ability to transform brief, incomplete messages into coherent, full distress signals. Through Large Language Models (LLMs) like Titan Text G1 - Express, Haven expands user input, turning simple keywords or short phrases into comprehensive messages. This is essential in high-stress situations where a woman may not have the time or mental clarity to articulate her circumstances in full. The model ensures that the message accurately represents the severity of the situation while still being discreet.
  - Example: If a user types ‚Äúhelp, scared, locked in room,‚Äù the AI expands it into a full message like: "I am trapped in my room, scared and unable to leave. Please help me." This message is then encoded in an image to be shared safely.
  - Using **Titan Text G1 - Express** LLM model

- Culprit matching
    - When a user reports a distress situation, details about the culprit's physical and behavioral characteristics are embedded as vector representations. These embeddings capture nuanced details about the individual, creating a unique profile that is stored in MongoDB‚Äôs vector database.
   - Similarity Search with Cosine Similarity:
    When an authority initiates a search by selecting "Find Match," the system performs a cosine similarity operation on the stored embeddings. By comparing the incoming profile with existing data, the system identifies top N matches based on similarity scores, allowing authorities to see connections across reported cases.
  - Using **Titan Text G1 - Express** LLM model

- AI-Powered Poem Generation üìù

  - In moments of emotional distress, sometimes the simplest words can bring comfort. Haven's AI-Powered Poem Generator provides empowering, reassuring poems designed to remind women that help is on the way and that they are not alone. The AI generates short, encouraging poems based on the user's emotional state or current needs. These poems are designed to provide emotional support and the assurance that change is possible.
  - Using **Titan Text G1 - Express** LLM model

- AI to Detect Severity of Situations üö®

  - The LLM processes large text inputs and sorts them based on the severity and nature of the abuse, making it easier for authorities to quickly take action without reading through long descriptions. 

- Image Generation üñºÔ∏è

  - AI is used to create custom images based on user input, such as landscapes, flowers, or everyday objects. This enables the use of steganography‚Äîembedding distress messages within the images. These generated images appear completely innocent to outsiders, while secretly containing encoded help requests.
  - Example: A user may select an image of a flower. The AI embeds a distress message, which looks like a normal social media post but contains a hidden cry for help when decoded.
  - Using **Titan Image Generator VI** LLM model

- AI-Powered Law Bot for Legal Support ‚öñÔ∏è

  - Haven‚Äôs Law Bot leverages AI to offer instant, confidential legal guidance. Trained on a vast array of legal resources‚Äîincluding national constitutions, local laws, and case precedents‚Äîthe AI provides women with easy-to-understand answers to their legal questions, empowering them to take control of their situations. The Law Bot breaks down complex legal jargon into simple language, ensuring clarity and accessibility.
  - Example: A user can ask, "What should I do if my spouse is abusing me?" and the Law Bot will provide a clear step-by-step answer based on the relevant legal rights, such as filing a complaint or seeking a restraining order. 
  - Using **Titan Text G1 - Express** LLM model

- Therapy Bot for Mental Health Support üí¨

  - Haven‚Äôs Therapy Bot uses AI to provide personalized mental health support. This bot offers coping strategies, emotional support, and mindfulness exercises to help women manage anxiety, depression, and PTSD. By analyzing the user's input, the AI tailors its responses to the emotional state of the user, ensuring relevant advice is given in real-time.
  - Example: If a user is feeling anxious, the Therapy Bot may suggest breathing exercises, a grounding technique, or offer calming affirmations to reduce stress.
  - Using **Titan Text G1 - Express** LLM model


- Vector Embedding for Personalized Experience üß†

  - To make interactions with the AI more personalized and contextually aware, vector embeddings are used to store and retrieve information. For each user, key data points (like their emotional state, past conversations, and preferences) are stored in MongoDB using embeddings generated from AI models like Sentence Transformers. This allows the AI to provide more informed responses over time.
  - Example: The AI can remember past interactions, such as a user‚Äôs previous emotional states or preferred coping strategies. This personalized knowledge allows the AI to provide more targeted advice, improving the support it offers over time.
  -  Using **Titan Text G1 - Express** LLM model and **LangChain for embedding**


### **How Atlas Vector Search Is Used in the Project ü§ñ:**

**(Category: Best Use of Atlas Vector Search)**

Atlas Vector Search is leveraged in this project to efficiently search and match perpetrators based on previously stored data embeddings, enabling quick identification of repeat offenders. The use of Atlas Vector Search allows authorities to find the closest matches for a given suspect profile based on various characteristics, such as physical and behavioral features, stored as vector embeddings

```
    results_cursor = collection.aggregate(
        [
            {
                "$vectorSearch": {
                    "path": "culprit_embedding",
                    "index": "culpritIndex",
                    "queryVector": description_embedding,
                    "numResults": num_results,
                    "numCandidates": num_candidates,  # Required for approximate search
                    "numDimensions": 768,  # Specify the dimensionality of the embedding
                    "similarity": "euclidean",  # Specify similarity metric
                    "type": "knn",  # Use "knn" for nearest-neighbor search
                    "limit": num_results,  # Set the limit parameter
                },
            },
            {
                "$project": {
                    "culprit": 1,  # Replace with the field that contains associated text
                    "culprit_embedding": 1,  # Include embedding only if needed
                    "_id": 1,  # Include the document ID if useful
                }
            },
        ]
    )
```
Key Benefits:

- Speed: Atlas Vector Search accelerates the process of finding similar offenders, providing authorities with actionable data quickly.

- Scalability: As the dataset grows, Atlas Vector Search scales seamlessly, allowing the system to handle an increasing number of reports and embeddings.

- Accuracy: By using cosine similarity and nearest-neighbor search techniques, the system ensures accurate and relevant matches, even when dealing with complex or subtle variations in the described characteristics.

### How Langchain Is Used in the Project

LangChain allows efficient processing of large PDFs by recursively splitting them into smaller, manageable chunks and converting them into embeddings for further analysis or search.

- Recursive PDF Splitting: LangChain‚Äôs PDFReader extracts text from PDFs, and the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splits the content into smaller sections based on size or logical breaks (e.g., paragraphs, chapters), ensuring that each chunk fits within token limits for embedding generation.
- Embedding Generation: After splitting the text, LangChain uses embedding models (e.g., OpenAI Embeddings) to convert each chunk into a vector representation. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text and can be stored in a vector database for similarity searches.
